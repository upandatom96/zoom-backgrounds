          This app is my personal homepage and sandbox. Who knows what I'll put
          here?

          This app is an Angular UI. For styling, It uses Bootstrap 4 (with SCSS
          for custom styling) along with Font Awesome 4 icons. I made the
          Favicon with Metro Studio.

        <p>
          This app relies on a simple Express API hosted at
          https://aoti-basic-express-app.herokuapp.com/.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frontend (Angular) and backend (Express) are both hosted on
          Heroku.
